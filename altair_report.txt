Altair- Chatbot – Temporary Report
-	Key requirements:
1.	Dataset built from scratch
2.	Image generation
3.	Chatbot for effective communication
4.	Good interactive UI
-	Dataset features:
1.	Various categories of products
2.	Time taken for each product
3.	Price per product
4.	Minimum wage/hour
5.	Yarn required for each product
6.	Type of yarn
7.	Price of each type of yarn
-	Mathematical relationship: Minimum Wage* Number of hours taken + Yarn Prices 
-	Working of the model:
o	Folder structure:
•	Crochet Project: 
o	Chatbot
o	Data
o	Generation
o	NLP
o	Dataset (Temporary for training): This is a dataset with 61 rows, with each row having a customer message, per say, “Crochet panda plushie around 25cm”. 
The dataset has types of products, their height, the width, the colors and certain characters.
o	Generator model:
	This is a stable diffusion image generator that creates clean e commerce style crochet products from a text prompt
	Imports: 
•	 os: used to create folders and manage file paths.
•	datetime: used to generate unique timestamps for filenames.
•	Torch: PyTorch, required for Stable Diffusion model execution.
•	StableDiffusionPipeline: the Diffusers library pipeline that loads SD and generates images.
	Creates a folder for generated images
	Loads the SD model from HuggingFace which runs on cpu
	Requirements:
- handmade crochet product
 	- isolated object
- full product clearly visible
- centered composition
- clean white background

o	NLP model:
	Pandas, torch + nn, DistilBERT, LabelEncoder are imported
	Convert characters and product labels into numerical values
	Tokenize text using DistilBERT- which outputs a 768-dimensional embedding per sentence
	Adam optimizer and MSEloss
	uses DistilBERT to convert text into an embedding and then predicts, product + size + colors + character from the embedding.
